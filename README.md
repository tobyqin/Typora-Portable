# Why need to be portable?

Typora is my favorite markdown editor, but every time using a new PC I have to reinstall it time to time. What's more, installing Typora needs administrator privilege, I might not have that on new PC.

# How do I create the portable package?

It is pretty simple to make a portable typora:

1. Prepare a clean VM
2. Install Typora 32 bit to C:\Typora
4. Delete some files that definitely not required, e.g. uninstall.*
3. Zip the installation folder
4. Publish the package to release page.

Does it work correctly? Yes, at least it works great per my test.

# Any other plan?

No, this repo might be not maintained lately, depends on my time. Current released version works great.
